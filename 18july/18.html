        Dear Mr. Andrews,
        
        I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective September 16, 2023.
        
        I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in late September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.</pre>
